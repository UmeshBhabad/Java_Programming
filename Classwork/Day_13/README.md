# 🔤 Day 13 — String Manipulation & Character Handling in Java

### 📚 What I Learned Today

---

## I. 🧵 String Data Type in Java
Understood how strings are immutable objects in Java and how they are stored in the String Constant Pool (SCP) or heap.

---

## II. 🔹 `str.charAt(int index)`
Used the `charAt()` method to access individual characters from a string using index positions.

Example:
```java
char ch = str.charAt(0);

## III. 🔁 String to Character Array

Learned different ways to convert a string into a character array for easy processing and iteration.

## IV. 🔹 str.toCharArray()

Used the built-in method to convert a string into an array of characters:

char[] arr = str.toCharArray();

## V. 🧩 Problems on Strings
a. Accept String

Reading input strings from user using:

Scanner

BufferedReader

b. Convert String to Character Array

Practiced transforming string into char array using both converting approaches.

c. Problems on Character Arrays

Solved various problems like:

Counting characters

Filtering characters

Modifying characters

Looping through character arrays

Checking conditions

📅 Focus of the Day: Understanding string operations, character access, and writing logic using character arrays in Java.
