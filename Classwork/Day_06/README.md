# 🧮 Day 06 — Arrays, Memory Concepts & Object-Oriented Coding in Java

### 📚 What I Learned Today

---

## I. 🧠 Dynamic Memory Allocation in Java  
Understood how Java allocates memory dynamically using the **heap**, how objects are created at runtime, and how reference variables point to memory locations.

---

## II. 📦 Arrays Declaration — Static & Dynamic  
- **Static Arrays:** Fixed-size arrays declared with a predefined length.  
- **Dynamic Arrays:** Arrays created using `new`, allowing flexible runtime memory allocation.

---

## III. 🔢 Problems on N Numbers  
Solved problems involving operations on *N elements*, such as summation, maximum/minimum, counting, and filtering techniques.

---

## IV. 🏗️ Writing Object-Oriented Code  
Learned how using **classes**, **objects**, and **methods** improves code reusability, readability, and maintainability.

---

## V. 🎭 Abstraction  
Practiced hiding internal implementation details and exposing only essential functionalities using abstract methods and classes.

---

## VI. 📚 Array-Based Problem Solving  
Worked on logical problems involving array traversal, searching, filtering, and applying optimized approaches.

---

📅 **Focus of the Day:** Strengthening concepts of memory, arrays, and OOP — and applying them to real programming problems.
