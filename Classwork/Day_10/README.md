# 🎨 Day 10 — Patterns, Nested Loops & Output Formatting in Java

### 📚 What I Learned Today
    
---

## I. ⭐ Problems on Patterns  
Solved various pattern-printing exercises to strengthen logical thinking, loop control, and structured output formation.

---

## II. 🔁 Nested Loop  
Revisited how nested loops work, focusing on:
- Outer loop controlling rows  
- Inner loop controlling columns  
- Structuring patterns precisely

---

## III. 🖨️ Formatted Output in Java (`printf`)  
Learned how to use `System.out.printf()` for:
- Alignment  
- Width formatting  
- Decimal precision  
- Cleaner and more controlled output  

Example:
```java
System.out.printf("%5d", num);

---

## IV. 📐 Non-Linear Patterns (Nested Loop)

Practiced triangle patterns, pyramid structures, decreasing patterns, and mirrored shapes using nested loops.

---

## V. 🔡 ASCII Table

Explored character-to-ASCII mapping and learned how:

Characters have numeric ASCII values

Typecasting between char and int helps build patterns and logic

---

📅 Focus of the Day: Strengthening control over loop structures, mastering formatted output, and understanding ASCII to build smarter patterns.
