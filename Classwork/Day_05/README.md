# 🧩 Day 05 — Strengthening Foundations & Input Handling in Java

### 📚 What I Learned Today

---

## I. ✅ Prerequisites Before Programming
1. **Understand the Problem Statement** — Clearly define what is required and expected from the program.  
2. **Write the Algorithm** — Prepare a step-by-step logical solution before coding.  
3. **Decide the Programming Language** — Choose the language based on problem requirements.  
4. **Write the Program** — Convert the algorithm into executable code.  
5. **Test the Program** — Validate output, check edge cases, and ensure correctness.

## II. 📥 Using `Scanner` Class  
Learned how to take user input using the `Scanner` class for integers, strings, characters, etc.

---

## III. 📥 Using `BufferedReader` Class  
Understanding how `BufferedReader` provides faster input handling and how to convert input strings into other data types.

---

## IV. ⚠️ Exception Handling  
Implemented `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks to safely handle runtime errors and prevent program crashes.

---

## V. 🗑️ Using Garbage Collector to Close Objects  
Understood how Java’s garbage collector manages memory and how closing objects helps resource optimization.

---

## VI. 🧱 Using Separate Classes for Main & Logic  
Applied object-oriented practices by keeping the **main class**, **logic class**, and **business logic** separate for better maintainability.

---

## VII. 🚀 Code Optimization  
Improved code structure, reduced redundancy, and wrote cleaner, more efficient solutions.

---

📅 **Focus of the Day:** Building strong programming fundamentals, improving input handling, using OOP structure, and writing safer and optimized Java code.
