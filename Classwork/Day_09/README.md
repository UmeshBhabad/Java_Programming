# ⭐ Day 09 — Pattern Printing & Nested Loops in C

### 📚 What I Learned Today

---

## I. 🎨 Problems on Patterns  
Practiced different types of pattern-printing programs to understand loop control, positioning, and structure.

---

## II. 📏 Linear Patterns  
Implemented simple single-loop patterns such as:
- Straight-line patterns  
- Repeated characters or numbers  
- Sequential number patterns  

Helped strengthen basic iteration skills.

---

## III. 🔁 Non-Linear Patterns (Nested Loops)  
Learned how nested loops help create:
- Square patterns  
- Triangles (left/right/aligned)  
- Increasing/decreasing sequences  
- Mixed symbol-number patterns  

Understanding inner vs. outer loop behavior was key.

---

## IV. 🔄 Iteration  
Reinforced how iteration controls pattern structure, repetition count, and shape formation.

---

## V. 🧩 Nested Loop Applications  
Explored how nested loops are used in:
- Patterns  
- Matrix operations  
- Multi-dimensional structures  
- Complex repetitive logic  

---

📅 **Focus of the Day:** Mastering nested loops and pattern logic to improve control flow understanding and structured problem solving.
